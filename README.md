# Cplusplus-Program

*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Corner Grocer project was running about running Python and C++ at the same time. Making both talk to each other and send data back and forth.
The problem it was solving was making two languages work together in an efficient manner. It also was about making two diffrent languages read and write files.

*What did you do particularly well?

I made the code as easy to read as I could. I also made the code so it could detect bad inputs or fails. I commented out everything that could be seen.
So for the most part I think I did good at making a simple and readable code.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I have to stop "using namespace" all the guides I have read and all the programming boards preach against it. While it makes the code easier to type it seems to come
with a lot of downsides. So while I give up convenience I get functionality and likley faaster compile times.

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the overall frequency print was the one I had the hardest time with. Getting rid of \n drove me nuts from the outside file then doing the item counts. I kept either getting an error or getting the number off. I finally found an iteration that worked for me.

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I think the work with the outside files is going to come in handy.
Especially when I think about generating bug reports or error logs. Programs tallking back and forth is always going to be important for programmers since there is
not a single universal langauge to code in.

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The code is broken up into functions, each function is named for what it does. I used minimium amounts of code and spaced it out as well.
Nothing complex or hard to follow just straight forward code. Since the code is written in sections it can easily added to or altered for whatever purpose some one desires.
